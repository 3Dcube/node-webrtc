libwebrtc stuff
----------

To build libjingle (from top-level directory):

1. Grab the depot tools (they may already be checked in, so you could skip this)
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git tools/depot_tools
export PATH=`pwd`/tools/depot_tools:$PATH

2. Get/update/build libwebrtc
mkdir -p lib/libwebrtc
cd lib/libwebrtc
gclient config http://webrtc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
gclient sync --revision r4953
gclient runhooks
ninja -C trunk/out/Release peerconnection_client


tests
----------

Once everything is built, try `node tests/test.js` as a sanity check. You can run the data channel demo by `node tests/bridge.js` and browsing to `tests/peer.html` in `chrome --enable-data-channels`.
